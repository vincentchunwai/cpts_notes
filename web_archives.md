## Wayback Machine

- Description: A digital archive of the World Wide Web, allowing users to see archived versions of web pages across time.
- Website: [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/)


- Crawling: The Wayback Machine employs automated web crawlers, often called "bots," to browse the internet systematically. These bots follow links from one webpage to another, like how you would click hyperlinks to explore a website. However, instead of just reading the content, these bots download copies of the webpages they encounter.

- Archiving: The downloaded webpages, along with their associated resources like images, stylesheets, and scripts, are stored in the Wayback Machine's vast archive. Each captured webpage is linked to a specific date and time, creating a historical snapshot of the website at that moment. This archiving process happens at regular intervals, sometimes daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the website's popularity and frequency of updates.

- Accessing: Users can access these archived snapshots through the Wayback Machine's interface. By entering a website's URL and selecting a date, you can view how the website looked at that specific point. The Wayback Machine allows you to browse individual pages and provides tools to search for specific terms within the archived content or download entire archived websites for offline analysis.
