# Vulnerability Assessment

## Methodology

1. **Conduct Risk Identification And Analysis**
   - Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in the system.
   - Analyze the likelihood and impact of each identified risk.

2. **Develop Vulnerability Scanning Policy**
    - Define the scope, frequency, and tools to be used for vulnerability scanning.
    - Establish roles and responsibilities for conducting scans and addressing findings.

3. **Identify The Type of Scans**
    - Determine the types of scans to be performed (e.g., network, application, database).
    - Choose between authenticated and unauthenticated scans based on the assessment goals.

4. **Configure The Scan**
    - Set up the scanning tools with appropriate settings and parameters.
    - Ensure that the scan configuration aligns with the defined policy and scope.

5. **Perform The Scan**
    - Execute the vulnerability scans according to the established schedule.
    - Monitor the scanning process to ensure it completes successfully.

6. **Evaluate and Consider Possible Risks**
    - Review the scan results to identify vulnerabilities and assess their severity.
    - Consider the potential risks associated with each vulnerability in the context of the organization's environment.

7. **Interpret the scan results**
    - Depending on the public exploit availability, CVSS score, and the asset's criticality, prioritize the vulnerabilities for remediation.
    - Document the findings and provide recommendations for mitigation.

8. **Create A Remediation and Mitigation Plan**
    - Develop a plan to address the identified vulnerabilities, including timelines and responsible parties.
    - Implement mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of exploitation.
