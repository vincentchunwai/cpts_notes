# CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

## Microsoft DREAD

DREAD is a risk assessment model used to evaluate the severity of security vulnerabilities. It stands for Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability. Each factor is rated on a scale from 0 to 10, and the overall risk score is calculated by averaging the scores of each factor.

## Exploitability Metrics

- Attack Vector (AV): This metric measures how the vulnerability can be exploited. It can be rated as Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), or Physical (P).

- Attack Complexity (AC): This metric measures the complexity of the attack required to exploit the vulnerability. It can be rated as Low (L) or High (H).

- Privileges Required (PR): This metric measures the level of privileges an attacker must have to exploit the vulnerability. It can be rated as None (N), Low (L), or High (H).

- User Interaction (UI): This metric measures whether user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability. It can be rated as None (N) or Required (R).

## CIA Triad

- Confidentiality (C): This metric measures the impact on the confidentiality of information. It can be rated as None (N), Low (L), or High (H).

- Integrity (I): This metric measures the impact on the integrity of information. It can be rated as None (N), Low (L), or High (H).

- Availability (A): This metric measures the impact on the availability of information. It can be rated as None (N), Low (L), or High (H).

## Temporal Metrics

- Exploit Code Maturity (E): This metric measures the maturity of exploit code available for the vulnerability. It can be rated as Not Defined (X), Unproven (U), Proof-of-Concept (P), Functional (F), or High (H).

- Remediation Level (RL): This metric measures the level of remediation available for the vulnerability. It can be rated as Not Defined (X), Official Fix (O), Temporary Fix (T), Workaround (W), or Unavailable (U).

- Report Confidence (RC): This metric measures the confidence in the existence of the vulnerability. It can be rated as Not Defined (X), Unknown (U), Reasonable (R), or Confirmed (C).
