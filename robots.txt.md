# Robots.txt

A `robots.txt` file is a text file that website owners create to instruct web robots (typically search engine crawlers) how to crawl and index pages on their website. It is part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) and is used to manage and control the behavior of web crawlers.

## Common Directives

- `User-agent`: Specifies the web crawler to which the rule applies. An asterisk (`*`) can be used to indicate all crawlers.
- `Disallow`: Tells the specified user-agent not to crawl a particular URL path.
- `Allow`: Tells the specified user-agent that it can crawl a particular URL path, even if a broader `Disallow` rule is in place.
- `Sitemap`: Provides the location of the website's XML sitemap to help crawlers find all the pages on the site.
- `Crawl-delay`: Specifies the number of seconds a crawler should wait between requests to the server.

## Robots.txt in Web Reconnaissance

- **Identifying Sensitive Areas**: By examining a website's `robots.txt` file, security researchers can identify areas of the site that the owner wants to keep private or restrict access to. These areas may contain sensitive information or administrative pages that could be of interest during a security assessment.

- **Understanding Site Structure**: The `robots.txt` file can provide insights into the structure of a website, including directories and files that are not meant to be publicly accessible. This information can help in mapping out the site for further analysis.

- **Bypassing Restrictions**: While the `robots.txt` file is intended to guide well-behaved crawlers, it does not enforce any actual restrictions. Malicious actors can use the information in the `robots.txt` file to find and target areas of the website that are not meant to be accessed.

- **Detecting Crawler Traps**: Some websites may use `robots.txt` to create crawler traps, which are areas designed to waste the resources of web crawlers. Security researchers can identify these traps and avoid them during their assessments.
