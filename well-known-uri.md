# Well-Known URIs

The .well-known URI path prefix is defined in [RFC 5785](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5785) and is used to define a standard location for well-known resources on a web server. These resources are typically used for configuration, discovery, or other purposes that require a consistent and predictable URL structure.

## Common Well-Known URIs

- `/.well-known/security.txt`: A file that provides security contact information for the website, as defined in [RFC 9116](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9116).

- `/.well-known/acme-challenge/`: Used by the ACME protocol (e.g., Let's Encrypt) for domain validation during the issuance of SSL/TLS certificates.

- `/.well-known/openid-configuration`: Provides metadat about an OpenID Connect provider, including endpoints and supported features.

- `/.well-known/assetlinks.json`: A file that contains links to various assets related to the website, such as icons or logos.

- `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`: Used by Apple to associate a website with an iOS app, enabling features like Universal Links.

- `/.well-known/mta-sts.txt`: A file used by email servers to specify policies for Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS).


## Exploration implications for Openid-configuration

1. **Endpoint Discovery**: The `openid-configuration` endpoint provides a wealth of information about the OpenID Connect provider, including the authorization endpoint, token endpoint, userinfo endpoint, and supported scopes. This information can be used to understand how to interact with the authentication system.

2. **JWKS URI**: The `jwks_uri` field in the `openid-configuration` response points to a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) that contains the public keys used to verify the signatures of tokens issued by the provider. Accessing this URI can provide insights into the cryptographic mechanisms in use.

3. **Supported Scopes and Response Types**: The `scopes_supported` and `response_types_supported` fields indicate what scopes and response types the provider supports. This information can help in crafting requests for tokens and understanding the capabilities of the authentication system.

4. **Algorithm Details**: The `id_token_signing_alg_values_supported` field lists the algorithms supported for signing ID tokens. This can provide insights into the security posture of the provider.
